## [Prerendering](https://github.com/ButterCMS/netlify-react-blog-tutorial#prerendering)
There are a number of ways to address this, including setting up server-side rendering and pre-rendering services like Prerender.io. But these options all require setting up and maintaining a Node.js server. Luckly, Netlify offers built-in prerendering which allows us to keep our code “serverless” while still making sure our blog is optimized for crawlers.
